        Hello and welcome to my motivation page. As Confucius' quotes site says:
      </p>
      <a

      <p>It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.</p>
      <p>
        I also love the concept of <em>positive</em> thinking, and The Need To
        Eliminate Negative Self Talk (as mentioned in Affirmations for Positive
        Thinking.)
